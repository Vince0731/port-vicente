# port-vicente
A portfolio of art creations from my notepads over the years.

As the son of a self proclaimed "talented artist who never reached their potential," I am commiting to exploring my artistic talents and curiosities. I have been drawing with graphite since I can remember. Crumpling countless pages in frustration because my drawing "didn't look like my dads." This was heavy motivation, and I became obsessed with detail and artistic style. I am an ameture by rule. What I lack in art education, I believe I make up for in passion, interest, and creative ability.

I hope you enjoy my portfolio as much as I enjoyed creating it. Please feel free to interpret and respond to the art however you feel compelled. 

True beaty is noticed when style meets substance.

Cheers!
